## 💭 Wisdom from Great Physicists

> *"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool."*  
> — **Richard Feynman** [web:21][web:23]

> *"No one must think that Newton's great creation can be overthrown in any real sense by this or by any other theory. His clear and wide ideas will forever retain their significance as the foundation on which our modern conceptions of physics have been built."*  
> — **Albert Einstein** [web:25]

> *"Turbulence is the most important unsolved problem of classical physics."*  
> — **Richard Feynman** [web:21]

> *"It is the facts that matter, not the proofs. Physics can progress without the proofs, but we can't go on without the facts."*  
> — **Richard Feynman** [web:21]

> *"Relativity applies to physics, not ethics."*  
> — **Albert Einstein** [web:22]
